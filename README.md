To modify my application to use a remote API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, I would:

- Set up a backend server (e.g. Node.js)
- Implement handlers for each CRUD operation (create, read, update, delete)
- Replace the local storage logic with API calls.
- Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the remote server. (e.g. GET /api/title)
